      <img class="pillars-images" src="\Vector\Siyam.jpg" width="30%"/>

      <p>
        <strong>Fasting in Islam (known as Sawm)</strong>, is the practice of abstaining, usually from food, drink, smoking, and sexual activity. During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Sawm is observed between dawn and nightfall when the evening adhan is sounded. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar and fasting is the fourth of the five pillars of Islam. It is obligatory upon every sane, post-pubescent Muslim, capable
of fasting the month of Ramadan - other than the women experiencing their
monthly menses or post-partum bleeding. Able children should be ordered to fast in
order to become accustomed to its practice.
      </p>
      <h4 class="sub-title">The time of Ramadan’s commencement is known by one of two signs:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li> Sighting the new moon by a trustworthy Muslim, male or female.</li>
        <li> Completing of thirty days of the month of Sha’ban.</li>
        
      </ol>
                      <p><strong>Note:</strong></br>The time of the obligatory fast is from Fajr until Maghrib. The person must
make his intention to fast before Fajr if it is an obligatory fast. </p>
                      <h4 class="sub-title">The Nullifiers of the Fast:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Sexual
intercourse in the vagina. One must make up that day and expiate the sin of this act by
freeing a slave, and if he cannot do that, he must fast two consecutive months. If he is
not able to either of those, he must feed sixty poor people, and for those that cannot do
even this, nothing is due</li>
        <li>Ejaculation due to kissing, hugging or masturbation, etc.
There is nothing due for a person who has a wet dream</li>
                      <li>Eating or drinking
something intentionally. If someone does so forgetting that he is fasting, the fast
remains correct (and he continues the fast till sunset)</li>
        <li> Letting blood, by means such
as cupping or blood donation. A little amount for a medical examination and
unintentional bleeding, like a wound, does not nullify the fast</li>
                      <li>Intentional vomiting</li>
        
        
      </ol>
                      
                      
                      
<h4 class="sub-title">Fasting is not nullified by the following: </h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Dust entering one’s throat</li>
        <li>Water unintentionally comes to one’s throat while washing his mouth</li>
        <li>Ejaculation due to thinking about sexual desires</li>
        <li>Wet dreams</li>
        <li>Unintentional bleeding</li>
        <li>Unintentional vomitting</li>
        
        
      </ol>
                      
                      <p><strong>Note:</strong></br> If someone eats thinking that it is night and then it becomes clear that it is the day,
he must make up for that day. If he eats doubting about the coming of the dawn,
thinking that it is still nighttime, his fast is still valid, but if he eats not certain about
the setting of the sun, and it happens to still be daytime, he must make up for that day.</p>
      
      
                      
                      
                      
                      
                      <h4 class="sub-title">Those not allowed to Fast:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>It is prohibited for a person to not fast unless he
has a legitimate excuse.</li>
        <li>Women in their monthly menses and postpartum
bleeding must break the fast.</li>
        <li>When saving someone’s life is conditional on
breaking a person’s fast, it is obligatory upon that person to break his fast.</li>
        <li>It is
Sunnah for the traveler to break his fast if the journey is long enough to allow
shortened prayers and if fasting is difficult for him.</li>
        <li>It is also Sunnah for a sick
person not to fast if he fears that fasting might cause him harm.</li>
        <li>It is allowed for a
resident to discontinue his fast if he travels during the day.</li>
        <li>It is allowed for a
woman who is pregnant or nursing to break the fast if she fears any harm on the
child or herself.</li>
        <li>All types of people mentioned above must make up the days
missed. The pregnant or nursing woman should additionally feed a poor person for
every day missed if she breaks her fast because she fears harm for the child only.</li>
        <li>If a person breaks his fast because of aging or because of a chronic disease from
which it is not expected that he will recover, then he must feed a needy person for
every day of Ramadan, and he does not have to make up those days.</li>
        <li>Whoever
postpones making up the days he missed until the next Ramadan due to a legitimate excuse, only needs to make them up. If his postponement was not for a legitimate
excuse, then he must make up the missed days in addition to feeding a needy person
for each day he did not make up.</li>
        <li>If a person dies without making up some
missed days due to some genuine excuse, then there is no sin on him and no making
up is required. If there was no legitimate excuse, a needy person must be fed for
each day missed and it is desired that someone from his relatives fast in lieu of him
for what he neglected of the fast of Ramadan or the fast of a vow. All vows to Allah
that do not entail disobedience to Allah should be fulfilled.</li>
        <li>If a person does not
fast for a legitimate reason and then this reason lapses during the day of fast,
similarly if a non-muslim accepts Islam, a woman becomes clean from her menses,
a sick person is cured, a traveler returns from the journey, a child reaches puberty,
or the temporarily insane person regains his sanity, all of these people must make
up the fast of that day in the midst of which this happened, even if they fasted for
the remaining portion of that day.</li>
                      <li>No one may fast in lieu of another who is
excused from fasting Ramadan.</li>
        
        
      </ol>
                      
                      
                      
                      <h4 class="sub-title">Voluntary Fasts:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>The best voluntary fast is to fast every other day.</li>
        <li>The
second best fast is to fast every Monday and Thursday.</li>
        <li>The next in line is to fast
three days of every month, during the days of the full moon, the 13th, 14th and 15th [of
the Islamic lunar month].</li>
        <li>It is from the Sunnah to fast most of the month of
Muharram and Sha’ban.</li>
        <li> It is also Sunnah to fast the day of Ashooraa (10th of
Muharram), the day of Arafat (9th of Dhul-Hijjah) and six days of Shawwaal.</li>
        <li>It is
disliked to single out the month of Rajab, Fridays, Saturdays, or the day of doubt (the
thirtieth day of Sha’ban, the month immediately preceding Ramadan) for fasting.</li>
                      <li>It
is prohibited to fast the day of Eid-al-Fitr or Eid-al-Adha. It is also prohibited to fast
the days of Tashreeq (11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah), except for the person who
must compensate for not slaughtering in making the Hajj-at-Tamattu’ or Qiran (see
pilgrimage - Hajj).</li>
        
        
      </ol>
                      
                      
                      
                      
                      
                      <h4 class="sub-title">Fasting is not nullified by the following: </h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>It is allowed for the person in the state of major impurity, like a person who has
had sexual intercourse or a woman in menses or postpartum bleeding who becomes
clean before the crack of dawn, to postpone his bath until after dawn [yet before
sunrise]. He may also take his predawn meal before his bath. This does not harm his
fast.</li>
        <li>It is allowed for a woman to take medicine to postpone her menses if she
intends by this to participate with the Muslims in the fast of Ramadan, on the
condition that this does not harm her in any way.</li>
        <li> It is allowed for the fasting
person to swallow saliva and mucous if it is within his mouth.</li>
        <li>The Prophet
(ﷺ) said, “My nation will remain on goodness as long as they hasten to
                      break the fast and take their pre-dawn meals at their latest time.” (Ahmad).</li>
                      <li>He
(ﷺ) also said, “The religion will continue to prevail as long as people hasten
to break the fast, because the Jews and Christians delay in doing so.” (Abu Dawud).</li>
        <li>It is a loved act that one makes a supplication when breaking his fast, since the
Prophet () said, “The fasting person, at the time of his breaking the fast,
has a supplication that will not be rejected.” (Ibn Majah). One of the invocations
reported is to say as the Prophet (ﷺ) said, “Dhahab ad-dhama’u wabtallitil-urooq wa thabat-al-Ajru insha-Allah” (Abu Dawud). (The thirst has disappeared, and
the veins are nourished, and the reward is confirmed, by the will of Allah).”</li>
        <li>It is
from the Sunnah to break fast with fresh dates. If fresh dates are not available, then
dry dates should be eaten. If neither of those two is available, he should break his fast
with water</li>
        <li>The fasting person should avoid K uhl (a kind of eye powder), eye
drops and eardrops in order to avoid the matters concerning which the scholars have
differed. If a person is in medical need of such drops, then there is no harm, even if he
feels the drops in his throat.</li>
        <li>It is from the Sunnah to use the Siwak at all the times
of the fast. There is no time in which it is disliked according to the correct judgment
of the scholars of jurisprudence.</li>
        <li>The fasting person must avoid all backbiting,
hate-mongering, falsehood, etc. If someone abuses the fasting person or curses him,
he should say, “I am fasting,” and guard his tongue and limbs from all that which is
sinful concerning his fast. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “For he who does not
leave off saying falsehood and acting upon it, Allah has no need for him to
leave his food and drink.” (al-Bukhari and Ahmad)</li>
        <li> It is from the Sunnah for a
fasting person who is invited to a meal to supplicate for the host and to partake in
breakfast, even if he is not fasting. </li>
        <li>The Honored Night (Lailat-ul-Qadr) is the
best night of the year. It falls in one of the last ten nights of Ramadan. The most
emphasized is the twenty-seventh night. The performance of good deeds on this
night is better than in a thousand months (about 83 years).</li>
        <li>This night has visible
signs, of which are a whitish dawn without much brightness of the Sun, and also
mild weather.</li>
        <li>A Muslim may pass by it without knowing it. One should perform
as much worship as possible in Ramadan and especially in the last ten nights,
seeking not to miss standing for prayers in any of these nights. If he stands in prayer
with the Imam for Salat-ut-Taraweeh, he should not leave until the Imam completes
the Taraweeh so that the whole night of his is written for him.</li>
        <li>It is Sunnah for the
person who begins a voluntary fast to complete it, but it is not obligatory. If he
intentionally breaks his fast, then there is no need to make that fast up as
compensation.</li>

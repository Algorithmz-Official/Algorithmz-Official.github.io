      <h4 class="sub-title">3.Sawm (Fasting)</h4>
      <img class="pillars-images" src="\Vector\Siyam.jpg" width="30%"/>

      <p>
        <strong>Fasting in Islam (known as Sawm)</strong>, is the practice of abstaining, usually from food, drink, smoking, and sexual activity. During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Sawm is observed between dawn and nightfall when the evening adhan is sounded. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar and fasting is the fourth of the five pillars of Islam. It is obligatory upon every sane, post-pubescent Muslim, capable
of fasting the month of Ramadan - other than the women experiencing their
monthly menses or post-partum bleeding. Able children should be ordered to fast in
order to become accustomed to its practice.
      </p>
      <h4 class="sub-title">The time of Ramadan’s commencement is known by one of two signs:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li> Sighting the new moon by a trustworthy Muslim, male or female.</li>
        <li> Completing of thirty days of the month of Sha’ban.</li>
        
      </ol>
                      <p><strong>Note:</strong></br>The time of the obligatory fast is from Fajr until Maghrib. The person must
make his intention to fast before Fajr if it is an obligatory fast. </p>
                      <h4 class="sub-title">The Nullifiers of the Fast:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Sexual
intercourse in the vagina. One must make up that day and expiate the sin of this act by
freeing a slave, and if he cannot do that, he must fast two consecutive months. If he is
not able to either of those, he must feed sixty poor people, and for those that cannot do
even this, nothing is due</li>
        <li>Ejaculation due to kissing, hugging or masturbation, etc.
There is nothing due for a person who has a wet dream</li>
                      <li>Eating or drinking
something intentionally. If someone does so forgetting that he is fasting, the fast
remains correct (and he continues the fast till sunset)</li>
        <li> Letting blood, by means such
as cupping or blood donation. A little amount for a medical examination and
unintentional bleeding, like a wound, does not nullify the fast</li>
                      <li>Intentional vomiting</li>
        
        
      </ol>
                      
                      
                      
<h4 class="sub-title">Fasting is not nullified by the following: </h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Dust entering one’s throat</li>
        <li>Water unintentionally comes to one’s throat while washing his mouth</li>
        <li>Ejaculation due to thinking about sexual desires</li>
        <li>Wet dreams</li>
        <li>Unintentional bleeding</li>
        <li>Unintentional vomitting</li>
        
        
      </ol>
                      
                      <p><strong>Note:</strong></br> If someone eats thinking that it is night and then it becomes clear that it is the day,
he must make up for that day. If he eats doubting about the coming of the dawn,
thinking that it is still nighttime, his fast is still valid, but if he eats not certain about
the setting of the sun, and it happens to still be daytime, he must make up for that day.</p>
      
      
                      
                      
                      
                      
                      <h4 class="sub-title">Those Allowed not to Fast:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>It is prohibited for a person to not fast unless he
has a legitimate excuse.</li>
        <li>Women in their monthly menses and postpartum
bleeding must break the fast.</li>
        <li>When saving someone’s life is conditional on
breaking a person’s fast, it is obligatory upon that person to break his fast.</li>
        <li>It is
Sunnah for the traveler to break his fast if the journey is long enough to allow
shortened prayers and if fasting is difficult for him.</li>
        <li>It is also Sunnah for a sick
person not to fast if he fears that fasting might cause him harm.</li>
        <li>It is allowed for a
resident to discontinue his fast if he travels during the day.</li>
        <li>It is allowed for a
woman who is pregnant or nursing to break the fast if she fears any harm on the
child or herself.</li>
        <li>All types of people mentioned above must make up the days
missed. The pregnant or nursing woman should additionally feed a poor person for
every day missed if she breaks her fast because she fears harm for the child only.</li>
        <li>If a person breaks his fast because of aging or because of a chronic disease from
which it is not expected that he will recover, then he must feed a needy person for
every day of Ramadan, and he does not have to make up those days.</li>
        <li>Whoever
postpones making up the days he missed until the next Ramadan due to a legitimate excuse, only needs to make them up. If his postponement was not for a legitimate
excuse, then he must make up the missed days in addition to feeding a needy person
for each day he did not make up.</li>
        <li>If a person dies without making up some
missed days due to some genuine excuse, then there is no sin on him and no making
up is required. If there was no legitimate excuse, a needy person must be fed for
each day missed and it is desired that someone from his relatives fast in lieu of him
for what he neglected of the fast of Ramadan or the fast of a vow. All vows to Allah
that do not entail disobedience to Allah should be fulfilled.</li>
        <li>If a person does not
fast for a legitimate reason and then this reason lapses during the day of fast,
similarly if a non-muslim accepts Islam, a woman becomes clean from her menses,
a sick person is cured, a traveler returns from the journey, a child reaches puberty,
or the temporarily insane person regains his sanity, all of these people must make
up the fast of that day in the midst of which this happened, even if they fasted for
the remaining portion of that day.</li>
                      <li>No one may fast in lieu of another who is
excused from fasting Ramadan.</li>

      <h4 class="sub-title">3.Sawm (Fasting)</h4>
      <img class="pillars-images" src="\Vector\Siyam.jpg" width="30%"/>

      <p>
        <strong>Fasting in Islam (known as Sawm)</strong>, is the practice of abstaining, usually from food, drink, smoking, and sexual activity. During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Sawm is observed between dawn and nightfall when the evening adhan is sounded. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar and fasting is the fourth of the five pillars of Islam. It is obligatory upon every sane, post-pubescent Muslim, capable
of fasting the month of Ramadan - other than the women experiencing their
monthly menses or post-partum bleeding. Able children should be ordered to fast in
order to become accustomed to its practice.
      </p>
      <h4 class="sub-title">The time of Ramadan’s commencement is known by one of two signs:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li> Sighting the new moon by a trustworthy Muslim, male or female.</li>
        <li> Completing of thirty days of the month of Sha’ban.</li>
        
      </ol>
                      <p><strong>Note:</strong></br>The time of the obligatory fast is from Fajr until Maghrib. The person must
make his intention to fast before Fajr if it is an obligatory fast. </p>
                      <h4 class="sub-title">The Nullifiers of the Fast:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Sexual
intercourse in the vagina. One must make up that day and expiate the sin of this act by
freeing a slave, and if he cannot do that, he must fast two consecutive months. If he is
not able to either of those, he must feed sixty poor people, and for those that cannot do
even this, nothing is due</li>
        <li>Ejaculation due to kissing, hugging or masturbation, etc.
There is nothing due for a person who has a wet dream</li>
                      <li>Eating or drinking
something intentionally. If someone does so forgetting that he is fasting, the fast
remains correct (and he continues the fast till sunset)</li>
        <li> Letting blood, by means such
as cupping or blood donation. A little amount for a medical examination and
unintentional bleeding, like a wound, does not nullify the fast</li>
                      <li>Intentional vomiting</li>
        
        
      </ol>
                      
                      
                      
                      <h4 class="sub-title">Fasting is not nullified by the following: </h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Dust entering one’s throat</li>
        <li>Water unintentionally comes to one’s throat while washing his mouth</li>
                      <li>Ejaculation due to thinking about sexual desires</li>
        <li>Wet dreams</li>
                      <li>Unintentional
bleeding</li>
                      <li>Unintentional
vomitting</li>
        
        
      </ol>
                      
                      <p><strong>Note:</strong></br> If someone eats thinking that it is night and then it becomes clear that it is the day,
he must make up for that day. If he eats doubting about the coming of the dawn,
thinking that it is still nighttime, his fast is still valid, but if he eats not certain about
the setting of the sun, and it happens to still be daytime, he must make up for that day.</p>

      <h4 class="sub-title">1.Shahadah (Testimony of Faith)</h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Shahadah</strong>, is the first pillar of Islam. Muslims bear
        witness to the oneness of God by reciting the creed,<br />

        “There is no true God worthy of worship but God and Muhammad is the last
        and final Messenger of God.”<br />

        This is simple yet profound statement expresses a Muslim’s complete
        acceptance of and total commitment to Islam.
      </p>
                   
                           
                           
                           
      <h4 class="sub-title">There are Six Pillars of Faith (Iman) in Islam:</h4>
      
     <ol class="list">
        <b><li>Belief in the existence and unicity of Allah</li></b>
                     <p>It’s the first and most important pillar. To believe in Allah is to believe that there is only one God worthy of worship, with no partner, or son. This concept is known as Tawheed. Also, it is to completely believe in the way he is described in the Quran, Sunnah and in his 99 names.</p>
        <b><li>Belief in the existence of Angels</li></b>
                     <p>The second pillar is to believe in Allah’s angels. They are not his children as some may think. They were created from light and were created before humans for the purpose of worshipping Allah.</br>

Angels do not sleep, eat or suffer from illnesses. It is crucial to believe in the angels, as they keep a record of our deeds. Some of the other duties of angles include: blowing the trumpet on judgment day, taking people’s souls (i.e. angel of death) and to be the keepers of heaven and hell.</p>
        <b><li>Belief in the books of Allah</li></b>
                     <p>The third pillar is to believe in the books of Allah which delivered to the nations by the messengers. Allah revealed books to his messengers as a form of guidance and proof for mankind. Among these books, is the Quran, which was revealed to Prophet Muhammad.</br>

Allah has guaranteed the protection of the Quran from any distortion or corruption and clearly mentioned that in the Holy Qur’an.</br></br>
                     <b>The books that were sent and known to mankind are:</b></br>
<img src="\Vector\Quran.jpg" align="right" width="18%">
                     <b>1.</b>The Scrolls (Suhof) that Allah revealed to the Prophet Ibrahim, peace be upon him</br>
<b>2.</b>The Psalms (Zaboor) that Allah revealed to the Prophet Dawud (David), peace be upon him</br>
<b>3.</b>The Torah (Torah) that Allah revealed to the Prophet Musa (Moses), peace be upon him</br>
<b>4.</b>The Gospel (Injeel) that Allah revealed to the Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him</br>
<b>5.</b>The Quran which sent with the last Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him</p></br>
        <b><li>Belief in Allah’s messengers and that Muhammad is the last of them</li></b>
                     <p>The fourth pillar is to believe in all prophets and messengers sent by Allah and that the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is the last of them.</br>

Most of the messengers of Allah were sent to a specific nation except Prophet Muhammad, who was sent to guide all of mankind. It is a duty of Muslims to send salaams (Peace and Blessings of Allah) when mentioning the names of any of the Prophets.</p>
        <b><li>Belief in the Day of Judgment</li></b>
                     <p>Muslims attest to the truth of everything Allah or his messenger, sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said about death.</br>

Allah has not created his creation in vain. He created men and jinn to worship him and promised paradise as a reward to those who obey him and his messengers, and promised hellfire to those who disobey him or his messengers.</br>

Allah has set a certain period for the whole universe, whose end will be the final hour. During the final hour, humans will be questioned about their deeds in this world. Those deeds will be weighed for them. One whose good deeds overweigh his evil deeds will prosper, while whose bad deeds outweigh his good ones will be condemned to hellfire – unless he died in the state of Islam. Then, Allah would either forgive him or punish him, and eventually, he would enter paradise.</p>
          <b><li>Belief in the Qadhaa’ & Qadr (Doom & Divine Decree)</li></b>                     
                    <p>Doom (Qadhaa’) is the general decree of Allah that every human shall die, whereas a divine decree (Qadr) is a particular decree of Allah or the execution of Qadhaa’, that a certain person is to die at a particular time and place. Hence, believing in this pillar entails believing that Allah has created everything and has foreordained its proper measure.</br></br>
                                                       <b>Moreover, The belief in Divine Predestination includes belief in four things:</b></br>

                     <b>1.</b>Allah is well acquainted with everything taking place, and His Knowledge encompasses everything.</br>
<b>2.</b>Allah has pre-assigned portions of everything in the preserved tablet.</br>
<b>3.</b>Nothing takes place in the heavens or on the earth without the will of Allah and his wish. Whatever Allah wills, takes place and whatever he does not, will do not take place.</br>
<b>4.</b>Allah is the creator of all things. There is no other creator besides him.</br></p>

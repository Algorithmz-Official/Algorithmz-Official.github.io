      <u><h1 class="title">Pillars of Islam</h1></u>
      <img class="Vector\pillars.png"  />
<p>There are 5 pillars of Islam. They are:</p>
<img src="Vector\Shahadah.jpg" align="right" width="10%" />
      <h4 class="sub-title">1.Shahadah (Testimony of Faith)</h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Shahadah</strong>, is the first pillar of Islam. Muslims bear
        witness to the oneness of God by reciting the creed,<br />

        “There is no true God worthy of worship but God and Muhammad is the last
        and final Messenger of God.”<br />

        This is simple yet profound statement expresses a Muslim’s complete
        acceptance of and total commitment to Islam.
      </p>
      
      <h4 class="sub-title">2.Salah (Prayer)</h4>
      <img src="Vector\Salah.jpg" align="left" width="15%" />
      <p>
        Call to Congregational Prayer (Adhan) and Announcement of the Beginning
        of Prayer (Iqamah).</br> Both the Adhan and the Iqamah are community
        obligations (Fard Kifaayah) for men who are not travelling (in a state
        of residence), while they are Sunnah for one praying alone and
        travelers. As for women, they are disliked (Makrooh).</br> Neither the Adhan
        nor the Iqamah are allowed to be made before their times, except for the
        Adhan of the Dawn Prayer (Fajr), for which the first of the two ( There are two adhaans 
        for the Fajr prayer, one for tahajjud (the voluntary night prayer) and one for Fajr.) is
        allowed to be called any time after the middle of the night.
        
      </p>

      <img src="Vector\Adhan.jpg" align="right" width="20%" />
      <h4 class="sub-title">Adhan (Call to Congregational Prayer)</h4>
      
      <p>While listening to the adhan, Muslims repeat the same words silently, except when the muezzin says: "حَيَّ عَلَىٰ ٱلصَّلَاة" or "حَيَّ عَلَىٰ ٱلْفَلَاح"  
        they silently say: "لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِٱللَّٰهِ‎" (there is no strength or power except from God).</p>
      <img class="images" src="Images\Azan.JPG"/>
      <p>When the Adhan ends recite:</br> اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَةِ التَّامَّةِ، وَالصَّلَاةِ الْقَائِمَةِ، آتِ مُحَمَّدا نلْوَسِيلَةَ وَالْفَضِيلَةَ، وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَاماً مَحْمُودا نلَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ، إَنَّكَ لَا تُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ
        ﺍﻟﻠﻬﻢ ﺻــﻞ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ ﻭ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﺁﻝ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ، ﻛﻤﺎ ﺻﻠﻴﺖ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﺇﺑﺮﺍﻫﻴﻢ ﻭ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺁﻝ ﺇﺑﺮﺍﻫﻴﻢ ﺍﻧﻚ ﺣَﻤِﻴﺪٌ ﻣَجيد. ﺍﻟﻠﻬﻢ ﺑﺎﺭﻙ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ ﻭ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﺁﻝ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ ﻛﻤﺎ ﺑﺎﺭﻛﺖ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﺇﺑﺮﺍﻫﻴﻢ ﻭ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺁﻝ ﺇﺑﺮﺍﻫﻴﻢ ﺍﻧﻚ ﺣﻤﻴﺪ ﻣﺠﻴﺪ
        </p>
      <h4 class="sub-title"> Iqamah (Announcement of the Beginning
        of Prayer)</h4>
        <img class="images" src="Images\Iqamah.JPG"/>
      <h4 class="sub-title">The Prerequisites (Shuroot) for the Prayer:</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>Islam</li>
        <li>Sanity (Aql)</li>
        <li>Discretion</li>

          the time of prayer.</li>
          <li>Covering the private areas
            according to one’s ability with something opaque. The extent of the private area for
            a male who has reached the age of 10 years or older is from his navel to the knee,
            and for a woman who has reached puberty is her entire body except her face in
            prayer.</li>

            according to the best of one’s ability.</li>

          <li>Intention (Niyyah)</li>
      </ol>
      <h4 class="sub-title"> The Prayer times are as follows:</h4>
      <img src="Vector\times.jpg" align="right" width="25%" />
      <ol class="list">
        <li>The time of Žuhr (Noon) prayer begins
          when the sun starts its decline after its zenith in the sky until the shade of anything is
          equal to its length.</li>
        <li>The time of Asr (Afternoon) prayer begins from the time Žuhr
          ends until the shadow of an object is double its own length; this is what is preferred,
          but due to need it can be extended until the sun sets.</li>
        <li>The time of Maghrib (Sunset)
          prayer starts after the setting of the sun until the disappearance of redness or
          twilight of the sky.</li>
        <li>The time of Isha (Night) prayer is up until the middle of the
          night ( Note that the middle of the night is not 12:00 a.m., but rather half the time between Maghrib and Fajr.)
          , and can continue up until the time of the dawn if necessary.</li>
        <li>The time of Fajr
          (Dawn) prayer begins at dawn ( The first appearance of light in the sky)
          , until the sun rises.</li>

</ol>

<h4 class="sub-title">The Essential Elements, or Pillars 
  (What is meant by pillars here are those actions which, if left, must be madeup for, or else the prayer
  is rendered invalid)
  of Prayer:</h4>
  <ol class="list">
    <li>Standing (Qiyaam) in
      prayer for those who are able;</li>
    <li>Saying Allahu Akbar (Takbeerat-al-Ihraam) for
      commencement of the prayer. This statement makes all other words and actions not
      related to the prayer prohibited. </li>
    <li>Reciting Surah-al-Fatihah.</li>
    <li>Bowing (Rukoo').</li>
    <li>Standing after Rukoo'</li>
    <li>Straightening up fully after Rukoo'</li>
    <li>Prostrations
      (Sujood, sing, Sajdah) on the seven parts of the body (two feet, two knees, two
      palms of hands, and the head which includes the forehead with the nose). </li>
    <li>Sitting
      up after the prostration and sitting between the two Sajdahs.</li>
    <li>Saying the last
      testimony (Tashahhud).</li>
    <li>Sitting for the last Tashahhud.</li>
    <li>Saying prayers for
      the Prophet (SAW) in the last sitting.</li>
    <li>Ending the Prayer with saying “AsSalaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah” (Tasleem).</li>
    <li>To perform each of these pillars
      properly, in that one settles fully into their positions.</li>
    <li>Performing all these pillars in the order mentioned above.</li>
</ol>
<p>The prayer is not regarded as valid except if these pillars are performed. If
  someone misses any of them in one unit (Rak’ah) of the prayer, that unit is void,
  whether it is left intentionally or forgetfully.</p>

  <h4 class="sub-title">The Obligatory Acts ( What is meant by the obligatory acts here are those 
    actions which, if left, the person must make two
    prostrations for forgetfulness at the end of the prayer, but need not make up the actual missed acts. 
    ) of Prayer:</h4>
    <ol class="list">
      <li>All of the Takbeeraat (saying
        “Allahu Akbar=Allah is the Greatest”
        ), apart from Takbeerat-ul-Ihram.</li>
      <li>Saying “Sami'a Allahu liman
        Hamidah=Allah answers he who praises Him” 
        , after standing from rukoo' by the Imam in a congregational prayer and
        by the individual if not in a congregation.</li>
      <li>Saying “Rabbana wa lakal-Hamd-O Our Lord to You is praise” 
        after standing from rukoo'.</li>
      <li>Saying “Subhÿaana Rabbiyal-Ažeem=Glory be to Allah, the Great” 
        once in the
       bowing.</li>
      <li>Saying “Subhaana Rabbiyal-A'laa=Glory be to Allah, the Exalted” 
        once in the prostration.</li>
      <li>Saying
        “Rabbi ighfir li=O Lord forgive me” 
         between the two sajdahs.</li>
      <li>The first Tashahhud.</li>
      <li>To sit for
        the first Tashahhud.</li>
    </ol>
<p>Whoever leaves any one of these eight obligations of sayings or actions
  intentionally, his prayer is void. If he leaves anything of them due to forgetfulness,
  he should make the two prostrations of forgetfulness.</p>

  <h4 class="sub-title">The Praiseworthy Acts (Sunan) of Prayer:</h4>
<p>They are of two types: sayings and
  actions. Not performing the Sunan acts of prayer does not invalidate the prayer,
  even if left intentionally. </p>

  <h4 class="sub-title">The Sunan of sayings include the following:</h4>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>reciting the opening supplication;</li>
    <li>seeking refuge from Satan (al-Isti’adhah);</li>
  <li>beginning the recitation of the
    Qur’an with the name of Allah (Basmalah);</li>
  <li>saying “Ameen” at the end of Surahal-Fatihah aloud in prayers in which the recitation is audible;</li>
  <li>reciting some verses
    from the Qur’an after the Fatihah; </li>
  <li>the Imam reciting aloud (the followers or
    ma’moom are prohibited to recite aloud. while a person offering his prayer
    individually is free to choose);</li>
  <li>saying “Hamdan Katheeran Tayyiban Mubarakan
    fihi Mil`as-Samaawaati wa Mil`al-Ari…” after saying “Rabbanaa wa-lakal-Hamd”;</li>
  <li>saying “Subhaana Rabbiyal-Ažeem”, “Subhaana Rabbiyal-A'laa” and “Rabbi
    ighfir li” more than once in bowings, prostrations and the sittings;</li>
  <li>saying a
    supplication before the final saying of “As-Salam alaikaum wa Rahmatullah.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="sub-title">The Sunan of actions include the following:</h4>
<ul class="list">
  <li>raising the hands at the time of
    Takbeerat-al-Ihram, at the time of bending for the rukoo’, at the time of raising up
    from it to a standing position, and at the time of standing up from the first atTashahhud;</li>
  <li> placing the right hand on the left below the chest while standing;</li>
  <li>keeping the eyes on the spot of prostration; keeping the feet separated while
    standing;</li>
  <li> placing the knees on the ground first, then the hands and the forehead when going down for prostration;</li>
  <li>keeping the stomach separated from the thighs,
    and separating the thighs from the calves in prostration;</li>
  <li>keeping a distance
    between the knees while bowing;</li>
  <li>keeping both the heels propped up while toes
    firmly placed on the ground with some distance between them and pointing [the toes]
    towards the Qiblah in prostration;</li>
  <li> placing the hands with the fingers together on
    the ground at the level of the shoulders while prostrating;</li>
  <li>standing up by putting
    the pressure on the feet first and then relying on the knees with the hands when
    standing;</li>
  <li> propping up the right foot and spreading the left while sitting on the left
    thigh in the sitting for the first Tashahhud (see the chart at the end of this book for
    two ways of sitting which is called Iftiraash);</li>
  <li> sitting on the buttocks keeping the
    left foot spread under the right leg and right foot propped up in the second atTashahhud 
    (see chart for three ways of sitting which is called Tawarruk);</li>
  <li>spreading the hands on the thighs with fingers joined together pointing towards the
    Qiblah between the two prostrations;</li>
  <li>making a circle with the middle finger and
    thumb of the right hand, and pointing the index finger during the remembrance of
    Allah and supplication, symbolizing the Oneness of Allah (SWT); </li>
  <li>turning to the
    right and then left when making the final salutations (Tasleem).</li>
</ul>
<img src="Vector\Prostration.jpg" align="right" width="20%" />
<h4 class="sub-title">Prostrations of Forgetfulness:</h4>
<p>It is from the Sunnah to make [two] prostrations
  of forgetfulness if one mistakenly recites something in a place where they should
  not, such as reciting the Qur’an in prostration. It is permissible to prostrate for
  leaving a Sunnah act of the prayer. However, it is an obligation (Wajib) to make the
  prostrations of forgetfulness if one adds a bowing, prostration, standing, sitting or
  gives salutations before the end of the prayer, or makes a clear mistake in the
  recitation of the Qur’an which changes its meaning, if one leaves any obligatory act,
  or if one is doubtful about an addition at the time of adding it.</br>
   The prayer becomes invalid if one intentionally leaves off making the obligatory
  prostrations of forgetfulness. A person may make these two prostrations before or
  after the final salutations. However, if one forgets to make the prostrations of
  forgetfulness until quite a while later after the completion of the prayer, then it is no
  longer necessary.</p>

  <h4 class="sub-title">The Description of the Prayer:</h4>
  <img src="Vector\salah-steps.jpg" align="right" width="25%" />
  <ul class="list">
    <li> One begins by facing the prayer direction (Qiblah) saying “Allahu Akbar”.</li>
    <li> The Imam (leader) says all the Takbeeraat (saying “Allahu Akbar”) aloud so that
      those following may hear him, while the followers say them quietly.</li>
    <li>He raises his hands at the beginning of the Takbeer near to his shoulders, and
      then he places his hands below his chest with his right hand on top of the left. </li>
    <li>He keeps his eyes at the place of his prostration and says an opening
      supplication which has been reliably reported in an authentic narration. For
      example, he may say, “Subhaanak Allahumma wa bi Hamdika wa
      Tabaarakasmuka wa Ta’alaa Jadduka wa la ilaaha ghairuk”
      “You are Glorified O Allah, and Praised; Your Name is Blessed; Your
      Majesty is Exalted, and none has the right to be worshipped but You.”</li>
    <li>Then he says “A’udhu billahi min-ash-Shaitan-ir-Rajeem” (I seek refuge in
      Allah from the accursed Satan). Then he says “Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Raheem”
      (In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent in Mercy, Most Merciful).</li>
    <li>All of this is stated quietly, and then he recites Surah al-Fatihah aloud if he is
      the Imam in a prayer in which is read aloud. It is recommended that the followers
      recite Surah al-Fatihah in the times of quietness of the Imam if the prayer is one
      which is read aloud, and obligatory if the prayer is one which is read quietly, i.e.,
      Žuhr and Asr</li>
    <li>Then he reads whatever else he wishes from the Qur’an. It is better to make his
      recitation of the Fajr prayer with the “Mufassal” chapters, of the “shorter” chapters in
      the Maghrib prayer, and in the rest of the prayers from the “medium” chapters. The
      longer Mufassal chapters are from Surah Qaaf [50] to Surah an-Naba’ [78], the latter
      to ad-duha [93] are known as the “medium”, and “shorter” from there to Surah anNas [114]. 
      The Imam recites aloud in the Fajr prayer and in the first two rak‘ahs of
      the Maghrib and Isha prayers. All other prayers are to be recited quietly. </li>
    <li>Then he raises his hands as he did in Takbeerat-al-Ihram and says “Allahu
      Akbar” and then bows. He puts his hands firmly on his knees while spreading his
      fingers and straightens his back such that the head is equal with his mid-section,
      neither higher nor lower. Then he says, “Subhaana Rabbiyal-Ažeem” (Glory be to
      Allah, the Great) three times.</li>
    <li> Then he raises his head saying, “Sami’Allahu liman Hamidah” (Allah answers
      he who praises Him). Then he raises his hands as he raised before bowing to a
      standing posture and says “Rabbanaa wa-lakal-Hamd ” (O Our Lord, to You is
      praise) adding to it, “Hamdan Katheeran Tayyiban Mubaarakan fihi Mil‘-asSamaawaati 
      wa Mil‘-al-Ar wa Mil‘a ma Shi’ta min Shay’in ba’d ” (Many praises
      that are pure and blessed, the fullness of the heavens, the fullness of the earth,
      and the fullness of whatever You wish afterwards).
      </li>
    <li>Then he prostrates while saying “Allahu Akbar”. He keeps his stomach away
      from his thighs and thighs from his calves while prostrating on his forehead and
      nose, both palms of the hands, both knees, and toes of both feet, with the fingers
      and toes pointing towards the Qiblah; and he says three times in the prostration
      “Subhaana Rabbiyal-A’laa” (Glory be to Allah, the Exalted). He can say that
      several times or he can supplicate whatever he wills.</li>
    <li>Then he raises his head saying, “Allahu Akbar” sitting on his left thigh while
      propping the right foot with the heel up and the toes planted to the ground facing the
      Qiblah. Then he says “Rabbighfir-li, warhamni, wajburni, warfa‘ni, warzuqni,
      wansurni, wahdini, wa-’afini” (O Allah forgive me, and have mercy on me, and
      strengthen me, and raise my rank, and give me sustenance, and give me victory,
      and guide me, and pardon me).</li>
    <li>Then he prostrates as the previous prostration and raises his head saying,
      “Allahu Akbar” and stands up repeating the second Rak’ah as the first. </li>
    <li>Then he sits in the state of Iftirash for the first testimony (at-Tashahhud alAwwal), 
      putting his right hand on his right thigh and left hand on his left thigh and
      making a fist of his right hand while making a circle with the thumb and middle
      finger and pointing with his index finger says “At- T a h i y y a a t u lillahi was-
      Salawaatu wat-Tayyibaat, as-Salaamu alaika ayyuhan-Nabiu wa Rahmatullahi
      wa barakatuh, asalamu alaina wa ala Ibadillahis-Saaliheen. Ash-hadu allaa
      ilaaha illallahu wa Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Abduhu wa Rasuluh” (The
      best of salutations and greetings are for Allah, and prayers and everything
      pure and good. May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be on you, O
      Prophet. May the peace be upon us and on the righteous slaves of Allah. I
      testify that there is none that has the right to be worshipped except Allah and I
      testify that Muhammad is His Slave and Messenger).</li>
    <li>Then he stands and prays the third and fourth Rak’ah, making them shorter than
      the first two. He recites in them Surah-al-Fatihah only and sits in the state of
      Tawarruk for the last testimony (at-Tashahhud al-Akheer) and says the same as in
      the first and adds to it, “Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa ala Aali Muhammad
      kama sallaita ala Ibraaheem wa ala Aali Ibraaheem, innaka Hameedum Majeed,
      wa Baarik ala Muhammad wa ala Aali Muhammad kama baarakta ala
      Ibraaheem wa ala Aali Ibraaheem, innaka Hameedum Majeed ” (O Allah, send
      prayers upon Muhammad and the followers of Muhammad, just as You sent prayers
      upon Abraham and upon the followers of Abraham. Verily, You are full of praise
      and majesty. And send blessings upon Mohammad and upon the family of
      Muhammad, just as You sent blessings upon Abraham and upon the followers of
      Abraham. Verily, You are full of praise and majesty).
       It is from the Sunnah to say “Allahumma Inni A’udhu bika min adhaabi
      Jahannam, wa min adhaabil-Qabr, wa min fitnatal-Mahya wal-Mamaat, wa min
      fitnat almaseeh ad-Dajjal ” (O Allah I seek refuge in You from the punishment
      of Hellfire, and from the punishment of the Grave, and from the trial of life
      and death, and from the trial of the Dajjal (Antichrist) . He then may also say
      other supplications as mentioned in the Qur’an and the Sunnah</li>
    <li>Then he says “As-Salaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah” (Peace and the Mercy
      of Allah be upon you) turning his head to his right and then saying the same,
      turning his head to his left.
       It is the Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW) to say some of the supplications after
      the completion of the prayer as mentioned in the Hadith (Some of these are as follows: 
      One says, “Astaghfirullah” [I ask for Allah’s forgiveness] three
      times, and then says, “Allaahumma antas-Salaam wa minkas-Salaam Tabaarakta ya Dhal-Jalaali
      wal-Ikraam” (O Allah You are the Peace, and from You is Peace, You are Blessed, O One of
      Majesty and Generosity). One also says, “LA ILAAHA ILLALLAH, wahdahu la shareeka lah,
      lahul-mulku walahul-hamd, wa huwa ’ala kulli shaiyin qadeer. La hawla wa la quwwata illa
      billah, LA ILAAHA ILLALLAH wala na’abudu illa iyyah, lahun-ni’matu walahul-fadl wa
      lahuth-thana-ul-hasan, LA ILAAHA ILLALLAH mukhliseena lahud-deen wa lauw karihalkafiroon. 
      la mani’a lima a’atait, wala mu’tiya lima mana’at, wala yanfa’u thal-jaddi minkal-jad.”).</li>

  <h4 class="sub-title">The Prayer of the One Who is Ill:</h4>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>If standing increases one’s illness or if a
      person is unable to stand, he should pray sitting. If one is not able to pray sitting, he
      should pray while lying down on his side. If one is not able to pray lying down on his
      side, he should pray on his back.</li>
    <li> If one is not able to perform the bowing and
      prostration, he should signal [with his body] to symbolize them.</li>
    <li>If one misses any
      of his prayers, he must make them up (as soon as pissible).</li>
    <li> If one is not able to
      make each prayer in its time, he may combine the Žuhr and the Asr prayers together,
      and the Maghrib and the Isha prayers together in either of their respective times.</li>
    
  </ul>


  <h4 class="sub-title">The Prayer of the Traveler:</h4>
  <img src="Vector\Traveller.jpg" align="right" width="15%" />
<ul class="list">
  <li>If the distance of the journey is more than
    around eighty kilometers, and it is a lawful journey, the person may shorten the
    Žuhr, the Asr and the Isha prayers from four Rak’ah to two. </li>
  <li>If the person
    intends to stay at his destination for more than four days – 20 obligatory prayers –
    he should perform them in their full forms and not shorten them.</li>
  <li>One should
    perform the prayers fully when praying behind an Imam who is resident.</li>
  <li> If one
    remembers a prayer in his journey that he had forgotten as a resident or viceversa, he should pray it in its complete form. </li>
  <li>The traveler may perform the
    prayers in their complete form if he wishes, yet to shorten them is better. </li>

</ul>


<h4 class="sub-title">The Friday Prayer (Salat-ul-Jumu’ah):</h4>
<img src="Vector\Jummah.jpg" align="right" width="15%" />
<p>This prayer is better than the Žuhr. It
  is an independent prayer and not a shortened form of Žuhr. It is not allowed to
  perform it with four Rak’ahs, to make it with the intention of Žuhr, or to combine it
  with the Asr prayer, even if there may be a valid reason for that</p>


<h4 class="sub-title">The Odd-numbered Prayer (Salat-ul-Witr): </h4>
<ul class="list">
  <li>This prayer is a Sunnah and it
    is to be made after Isha until the time of Fajr. </li>
  <li>The least number of Rak’ahs for
    the Witr prayer is one Rak’ah, and the most number of Rak’ahs one may pray is
    eleven.</li>
  <li>It is better to make the salutation after every two Rak’ahs.</li>
  <li> The least
    complete form of Witr prayer is to perform it in three Rak’ahs with two salutations
    [meaning performing two Rak’ahs and making the salutations and then one Rak’ahs by itself with another salutation at the end of it].</li>
  <li>It is Sunnah to recite Surat-ulA’la [87]in the first Rak’ah, Surat-ul-Kaafiroon [109] in the second and Surat-ulIkhlaas [112] in the third Rak’ah.</li>
  <li> It is recommended that you make Qunoot after
    bowing (rukoo’), by raising your hands and supplicating aloud even if you are
    praying alone.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="sub-title">Funerals (Janaazah):</h4>
<img class="images" src="Vector\Janazah.jpg"   />
<ul class="list">
  <li>Washing the deceased Muslim’s body, placing the
    shroud upon him, making the funeral prayer, carrying him and placing him in the
    grave are all community obligations (Fard Kifaayah).</li>
  <li> Martyrs in Islamic Jihad
    are not to be washed or placed in the shroud, but rather should be buried as they
    died and it is allowed to pray the funeral prayer upon them.</li>
  <li>The shroud of the
    Muslim male contains three sheets while the female’s shroud should be of five
    sheets: a loincloth, head covering, upper wrap and two over-all wraps. </li>
  <li> The
    Sunnah is for the Imam or a person praying alone to stand at the chest of the male
    and the middle of the female. </li>
  <li>One stands and says “Allahu Akbar” four times,
    raising his hands every time: in the first he says “Allahu Akbar” and seeks refuge
    in Allah, says “Bismillah” and reads only al-Fatihah quietly; in the second he says
    “Allahu Akbar” and reads the salutations on the Prophet (
    al-lal-laahu
    alaihi wa sal-lam); in the third
    he says “Allahu Akbar” and supplicates to Allah for the deceased; in the fourth he
    says “Allahu Akbar” and then stands a bit and then says “as-Salaamu alaikum”. </li>
  <li> It is not allowed to raise the grave above the level of the ground except a hand
    span, to put any type of plaster on it, to kiss it, to place incense near it, to write on
    it, to sit or walk on it, to place any kind of illumination on it, to circumambulate
    around it, to build a mosque on it, or to place a grave in a mosque. Moreover any
    tombs (or buildings) built over a grave must be demolished.</li>
    <li>There are no restrictions about the words of solace and condolences for the grieving
      relatives. A person may say, “A’dham Allahu Ajrak wa Ahsan Aza‘ak wa Ghafara li
      Maitak” (May Allah increase your reward and bestow goodness to you in your
      grief and forgive your deceased). He may say when consoling a Muslim who has lost
      a relative who was a disbeliever, “Adham Allah Ajrak wa Ahsan Aza‘ak” (May Allah
      increase your reward and bestow goodness to you in your grief).</li>
    <li> It is obligatory for a person who knows that his family will wail over him upon
      his death to write a will advising them not to do so; otherwise, he may be punished
      by their wailing on him. </li>
    <li> Imam Shaafi’i, said that it is disliked that one sits for the condolences, referring
      to the gatherings in which the family of the deceased waits for those who desire to
      visit them for condolences. Instead, they all should go about their business, whether
      men or women.</li>
    <li>It is from the Sunnah to prepare food for the grieving family (since they are
      preoccupied by their grief) and it is disliked to eat of their food or to prepare food
      for the people who gather at their place. </li>
    <li> It is from the Sunnah to visit the graves as long as it does not entail travelling. It
      is also allowed to visit the grave of a non-muslim. A non-muslim should not be
      prohibited from visiting the grave of a Muslim. </li>
      <li>It is from the Sunnah to say when entering the graveyard of Muslims:
        “Assalamu alaykum ahlad-diyari min-al-mu‘mineena, wa-inna in sha‘Allahu
        bikum lalahiqoon, yarhamullah al-mustaqdimeena minna wal-musta‘khireen,
        nas‘alAllaha lana walakum-ul-aafiyah, Allahumma laa tahrimna ajrahum, wa
        laa taftinna ba’dahum, waghfir lana wa lahum” (Peace be upon you all, O
        inhabitants of the graves, from among the believers and the Muslims. Verily we
        will, Allah willing, be united with you. May Allah forgive those of you that
        proceeded and those that will come afterwards. We ask Allah for us and you
        well being. O Allah do not deprive us of the reward and do not tempt us after
        them, and forgive us and them). 
        </li>

<h4 class="sub-title">The Prayer of the Two Eid Festivals (Eid al-Fitr, Eid-al-Adha) : </h4>
<img src="Vector\Fitr.jpg" align="right" width="15%" />
<img src="Vector\Adha.jpg" align="right" width="15%" />
<ul class="list">
  <li>This prayer
    is a community obligation (Fard Kifaayah) and the time for it is after the sunrise like
    the time of Salat ul-dhuha. If people do not come to know that the day of Eid has
    come until after noon, it should be made the following day as a make up prayer. </li>
  <li>The conditions are like the conditions of Salat ul-Jumu’ah except for the two sermons;
    the two sermons of Jumu’ah are delivered before the prayer while the two sermons of
    Eid are delivered after the prayer.</li>
  <li>It is disliked that one makes any supererogatory
    prayer before or after it in the place where it is performed.</li>
  <li>This prayer has two
    Rak’ahs. In the first bowing (Rak’ah), one says Takbeerat al-ihraam, “Allahu
    Akbar,” to commence the prayer and then says “Allahu Akbar” six times again before
    seeking refuge in Allah and reciting the Qur’an. In the second Rak’ah one says
    “Allahu Akbar” five times before reciting the Qur’an. One raises the hands for each
    Takbeer. Then the Imam seeks refuge in Allah and recites aloud al-Fatihah followed
    by Surah Sabbih [87] in the first Rak’ah and by al-Ghaashiyyah [88] in the second
    Rak’ah. The Imam then delivers two sermons like in the Friday Prayer, except that he
    should repeat often Allahu Akbar. </li>
  <li> If one makes this prayer like a supererogatory
    prayer, it is acceptable and correct since the Takbeeraat are additional and praising
    Allah and sending salutations on the Prophet (
    al-lal-laahu
    alaihi wa sal-lam) between them are Sunnah.</li>
  
</ul>



<h4 class="sub-title">Prayer of Eclipse (Salat ul-Kusoof or Khusoof):</h4>
<img src="Vector\Eclipse.jpg" align="right" width="15%" />
<ul class="list">
  <li>This is a Sunnah prayer,
    and its time is from the beginning of the eclipse, whether lunar or solar, until it
    finishes.</li>
  <li> It is not to be made up for if the eclipse is over. The way in which it is
    done is to pray two Rak’ahs in which the Qur’an is recited aloud.</li>
  <li>In the first
    Rak’ah, one should recite al-Faatihah and a long surah, then do a long bowing
    (rukoo’), then raise one’s head and say, “Sami’a Allahu lIman hamidah, Rabbanaa
    wa laka’l-hamd” (Allah listens to the one who praises Him; our Lord to You be
    praise)” after standing upright, as in other prayers.</li>
  <li>After that he does not go into
    prostration like in other prayers. Instead, he should then recite al-Faatihah again
    and another long surah. Then comes another long bow (rukoo’). After that, one
    raises his head and stands upright.</li>
  <li> Then he should do two lengthy prostrations
    (sujoods).</li>
  <li>Then one should pray the second rak’ah like the first.</li>
  <li>Then he
    should recite the tashahhud and say the salaam.</li>
  <li>If a person comes late missing
    the first bowing (Rak’ah), he has missed that Rak’ah and will have to make it up. </li>
</ul>




<h4 class="sub-title">Prayer for Rain (Salat-ul-Istisqa’a) :</h4>
<img src="Vector\Rain.jpg" align="right" width="20%" />
<p>It is Sunnah to pray it in case there is a
  drought or lack of rain. The manner of performing this prayer is like the Eid
  Festival Prayer except that one makes the sermon after the prayer.
   The Sunnah is to reverse one’s cloak as an indication of optimism for a change
  of circumstances once the prayer is over. </p>




      <h4 class="sub-title">3.Zakat</h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Zakat</strong>, is the third pillar of Islam. Muslims bear
        witness to the oneness of God by reciting the creed,<br />

        “There is no true God worthy of worship but God and Muhammad is the last
        and final Messenger of God.”<br />

        This is simple yet profound statement expresses a Muslim’s complete
        acceptance of and total commitment to Islam.

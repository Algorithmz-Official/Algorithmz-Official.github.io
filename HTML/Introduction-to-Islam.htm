      <h1 class="title">Introduction to Islam</h1>
      <h4 class="sub-title">WHAT IS ISLAM?</h4>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Islam is the complete way of life for all humanity.</li>
        <li>
          It is the religion of submission to one god (Allah), the religion of
          peace, mercy, and forgiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is the universal religion that calls for “ONE PEOPLE UNDER ONE
          GOD.”
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="sub-title">WHAT DOES ISLAM MEAN?</h4>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Islam means submission to one god (Allah) and it also means ‘peace.’
        </li>
        <li>
          The word Muslim means the one who has submitted him/herself to God and
          lives with peace.
        </li>
        <li>
          If one’s life is not peaceful, he/she should be concerned about
          his/her level of submission to Allah. The more you submit yourself to
          Allah, the more you enjoy peace, tranquility, and contentment in life.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="sub-title">IS ISLAM AN ARAB RELIGION?</h4>
      <p>
        No! Islam is a religion for all humanity. It is the first religion,
        which had a universal beginning. The early followers of Prophet Muhammad
        (ﷺ) came from Arabia, Africa, Iran, Asia, and the West. Racism,
        tribalism, and nationalism divided the world before Islam. The rich
        considered the poor as people of lower classes. Islam came with: “O
        people! God created you from a single pair of male and female and made
        you unto tribes and nations so that you may know one another (not to
        chastise one another) The best among you is the one who is the most
        conscious of God” (Al Qur’an: 49:13).
